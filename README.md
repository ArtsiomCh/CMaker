## **CMake plugin for IntelliJ Idea CE**

This is a CMake support plugin for IntelliJ Idea IDE. It brings syntax highlight support for CMake build and run system.
It is my play project to study intellij language support. Work is still in progress.


## **License**

Plugin is open-source software and is licenced under GPL v3 licence.

## **Versions**

**v.0.0.1**
* Supports basic syntax highlight, folding, gutter icons and psi structure.

## **Build Instruction**

* To get started you need the IntelliJ Plugin development SDK, *Grammar-Kit* plugin (to build parser and lexer from bnf grammar)

* Download the code, set Plugin SDK and Java SDK

* In project properties set the `plugin.xml` location
* Hover the `grammar/cmake.bnf` and generate parser code
* Custom jflex lexer is used, so use existing lexer instead of generating from bnf. Custom lexer now contains state to distinguish between the command name and argument.
* In project properties mark gen as source folder
* Generate lexer class from `*.flex` file
* Build project and you are set to go
