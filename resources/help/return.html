    <p>Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is
        encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()), it
        causes processing of the current file to stop and control is returned
        to the including file.  If it is encountered in a file which is not
        included by another file, e.g.  a CMakeLists.txt, control is returned
        to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is called in a
        function, control is returned to the caller of the function.  Note
        that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a
        function does.</p>
